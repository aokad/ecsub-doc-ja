You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/aokad/ecsub-doc-ja/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Markdown

## Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/aokad/ecsub-doc-ja/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

# What is hotsub?

`hotsub` is a command line tool to execute batch jobs on cloud services, like AWS, GCP and so.   For example,

```sh
hotsub --script ./hello.sh --tasks ./world.csv
```

![Example 001](/assets/img/example-001.png)

This command will automatically launch several EC2 instances on AWS and execute your `./hello.sh` on the instances for each sample which is specified as a row in your `./world.csv`.
